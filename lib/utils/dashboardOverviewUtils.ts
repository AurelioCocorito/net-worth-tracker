/**
 * Per-asset market (price) effect since the previous snapshot, keyed by assetId.
 *
 * WHY price effect and not value delta: the digest under the hero is meant to say what the
 * MARKET did, and a class-level value delta cannot tell a price move from the user's own
 * buying and selling — selling 14.000 € of cash to buy crypto used to read as
 * "Liquidità −14.110 · Criptovalute +11.869", which is a description of the user's trades,
 * not of any return. The split comes from `attributeSelectedChange`, the same
 * price/quantity attribution Storico → Valore per Strumento uses, applied one asset at a
 * time: priceEffect = q_prev × (u_curr − u_prev) on the quantity held at the START of the
 * period, where u is the effective EUR unit value. Consequences worth knowing:
 *   - an instrument TRADED since the previous snapshot is measured from the ledger instead
 *     (`tradeAwarePriceEffect`): the price move of the quotes bought or sold in the month, from
 *     the trade price to today, is market too — a position opened this month used to contribute
 *     0, and on the real account settembre 2026 that parked +538 € in «tuoi movimenti», which the
 *     owner read as income − expenses (2026-09-19);
 *   - cash (unit value 1) and any hand-valued asset kept at price 1 can never show a market
 *     effect — their growth lands in the quantity effect by construction. PENSION FUNDS are the
 *     exception, handled separately: their value lives in `quantity` at price 1 and moves for two
 *     reasons, contributions and the fund's own return, so the return is `Δvalue − contributions
 *     registered since the previous snapshot` (attributed by `valueEffectMonth`, the same rule
 *     Previdenza's "Rendimento del fondo" uses). Only from `startMonth` on: before it,
 *     contributions were not recorded and the whole growth would read as return, so the fund
 *     contributes 0 — the settings card says exactly this;
 *   - real estate is measured GROSS of debt: `calculateAssetValue` nets the mortgage out, so on
 *     the net value a mere instalment would read as the property appreciating (measured on the
 *     real account: "Immobili +1.036 €" in a month where only the debt moved). The snapshot's
 *     raw `price` is the gross property value, so both sides use `quantity × price` instead.
 *
 * Returns null when the previous snapshot has no per-asset breakdown (older or hand-entered
 * snapshots): with class totals only, nothing honest can be attributed.
