# Rendimenti

> **Quando aprire questa guida** — chi tocca `app/dashboard/performance/page.tsx`, `components/performance/*`, i moduli puri `lib/utils/{performanceNarrative,performanceSummary,performanceBase,drawdownSeries}.ts` o `lib/services/performanceService.ts`. In `AGENTS.md` resta lo stub con l'essenziale; qui c'è la regola completa. Moduli e file: § *Files*, sotto. Spec Playwright: `e2e/performance.degraded.spec.ts` sulla fixture `npm run e2e:seed -- performance` (struttura e cablaggio, non l'aritmetica — vedi *Per-page blind spots*).

## Files

Moved here from `CLAUDE.md` → *Key Files* on 2026-09-19.

- **Rendimenti**: `app/dashboard/performance/page.tsx`, `components/performance/*` (+ `tiles/*`, `AttribuzioneTile`; the hand-written plots glide through `lib/hooks/useMorphingSeries.ts` over pure `lib/utils/seriesMorph.ts`), pure `lib/utils/{performanceNarrative,performanceSummary,performanceBase,portfolioFlows,performanceAttribution,drawdownSeries,cashFlowMap,benchmarkPeriodReturn}.ts` (`resolvePerformanceBase` = the ONE base for service, page and PDF; `externalFlowOf`/`mergePensionFlows`/`mergePortfolioFlows` = the two flow channels; `buildPortfolioBoundaryFlows` = the measured boundary; `resolvePeriodReturnChip`/`deannualizeReturn`; `attributePeriodReturn` + `RESIDUAL_ALERT_SHARE` = the residual guard), `lib/services/performanceService.ts` (`CACHE_MATH_VERSION`); cache `performance-cache/{userId}`; spec `e2e/performance.degraded.spec.ts` on `npm run e2e:seed -- performance`. Yields: `lib/utils/yieldOnCost.ts` (`computeDividendYieldMetrics`, also behind `app/api/dividends/stats/route.ts`), `lib/utils/dividendYield.ts` (`computeYieldsForPeriods`, the twelve yield fields per period), `app/api/performance/yields/route.ts`, `lib/services/performanceYieldsService.ts` (the client reader, the PDF's too). Reads: `lib/hooks/usePerformanceData.ts` (every read of the page), `lib/query/performanceQueries.ts` (the two queries, built together — pure), `resolvePerformanceSetup` / `resolveYieldPeriods` / `PerformanceInputs` in the service
- **Benchmark**: `lib/constants/benchmarks.ts`, `app/api/benchmarks/*`, `lib/server/ecbRatesService.ts`; caches `benchmark-cache/*`, `fx-rate-cache/usd-eur`, `ecb-rate-cache/deposit-rate`
- **Suites to run after a change here — Rendimenti** (moved from `AGENTS.md` § Commands on 2026-09-30): `performanceService` (+ `performanceBase`, `drawdownSeries`, `cashFlowMap`) · **Attribuzione** `performanceAttribution`, `snapshotAssetBreakdown` · **Verdetto e letture** `performanceNarrative`, `performanceSummaryTiles`, `performanceSummary` (+ `patrimonioNarrative` for the articles) · **Letture e rendimenti da dividendo** `performanceInputs`, `performanceQueries`, `dividendYield`, `performanceYieldsRoute` (+ `persistCache`) · **Analizza con AI** `analyzePerformanceRoute` (`app/api/ai/analyze-performance/route.ts`: the overload, the refusal, the `max_tokens` cut, the server-side fallback) + `performanceNarrative` (`describeReportAuthor`) · **Browser** `e2e/performance.degraded.spec.ts`, `e2e/mobile-composition.performance.degraded.mobile.spec.ts` (390, project `degraded-mobile`, since 2026-10-14), `e2e/modal.origin.spec.ts`

## Rendimenti — every collection read once (`lib/hooks/usePerformanceData.ts`, `lib/query/performanceQueries.ts`)

- **Depth two, eight API calls** (2026-10-04; it was four to five round trips in series and seventeen calls). First the six
  collections through the app's shared hooks — snapshots, assets, settings, pension contributions, dividend receipts, the
  ledger — then, TOGETHER, the pre-computed metrics and the dividend yields. The page never calls a read service and never
  holds the collections in state: `usePerformanceData(ownerId)` is its one door, and the base its charts read is
  `resolvePerformanceSetup(inputs).base`, the service's own resolution.
- **`getAllPerformanceData(userId, forceRefresh, inputs?)` takes the inputs already read**: the page hands over what the
  hooks hold, so the service reads only `performance-cache/{uid}` (one `getDoc`) and, on a miss, the expenses. Without
  `inputs` it reads the five collections itself and computes the same payload (`__tests__/performanceInputs.test.ts`: the
  equivalence, seen red with `assets: []` handed over). `resolvePerformanceSetup` is the pure head of that function — base,
  risk-free rate, dividend category, cache key — and the page's metrics query is NAMED by that cache key
  (`['performance', 'data', uid, cacheKey]`): the metrics are read again exactly when an input that decides them changes.
- **The yields: one route, asked with the metrics, never after them.** `POST /api/performance/yields` takes the periods in
  its body and reads dividends, assets and snapshots ONCE (the two routes it replaced, `/api/performance/yoc` and
  `/api/performance/current-yield`, each read the three per period: thirty collection reads for five periods). The windows
  it is asked come from `resolveYieldPeriods(base.snapshots, now)`, which runs the SAME selection and the SAME derivation
  as the metrics (`resolveMeasuredWindow`, read by `calculatePerformanceForPeriod` too) — so the call leaves before the
  metrics exist, and the two can never describe different windows on a fresh computation.
  `__tests__/performanceQueries.test.ts` holds the order with a metrics read that never resolves. The custom range and the
  PDF ask the same route with their one window.
- **The yields live in React Query, NOT in `performance-cache`**: that document's key covers the snapshots, the base, the
  rate and the dividend category — not the dividends registry and not today's prices, which YOC and current yield read. In
  the Firestore cache they would be stale for up to six hours with nothing to invalidate them (AGENTS.md § Caching: the key
  encodes EVERY determining input). The query is named by its windows, the dividend cap by its DAY
  (`describeYieldPeriods`: the cap of an open period is «now», and a name carrying the instant would be new at every load);
  the request carries the exact instant. `CACHE_MATH_VERSION` did not move: the cached document has the shape it had.
- **Both payloads are persisted** (`['performance', 'data']`, `['performance', 'yields']` in
  `lib/constants/persistCache.ts`, the owner's decision, 2026-10-04): a reload paints the last known figures with
  «Aggiornato alle…» in the header and rereads behind them — first figure at ~90 ms on the mirror, it was ~440, with no
  page skeleton. With only the six collections restored the hero waited one round trip under a skeleton, and the header
  said «sto rileggendo» over it. A change of shape of `PerformanceData` now owes a `PERSIST_CACHE_VERSION` bump.
- **«Aggiorna» reads everything anew and stands the observers still** (`paused`): it invalidates the six keys, recomputes
  the metrics with `forceRefresh` on the fresh inputs and asks the yields again, the two together, then moves the page's
  clock so its queries find both answers under their keys. A custom range is dropped by a refresh (it was measured on the
  snapshots of before) and the page returns to the year to date — until 2026-10-04 the refresh left «CUSTOM» selected with
  no metrics, which read as «servono almeno due snapshot».
- **A yield that cannot be read is not a failed page**: the yields gate the WAIT (the hero appears with them) but not the
  failure — the metrics show without them, as with the old routes, and the query does not retry.

## Rendimenti — measurement base (`lib/utils/performanceBase.ts`, `drawdownSeries.ts`)

- **Any exclusion read from `byAsset` MUST be backfilled across the pre-`byAsset` months, or it becomes a phantom crash**:
  subtract a **constant `E₀`** (the excluded total of the earliest snapshot that HAS one), which cancels in `(V_end −
  CF)/V_start`. A snapshot that has `byAsset` but omits the asset is evidence of absence → subtract 0, never backfill.
  **Documented approximation**: the backfill fixes the DENOMINATOR of historical months, not the numerator.
- **ONE resolution, THREE callers** (2026-09-06, the PDF since 2026-09-07): `resolvePerformanceBase({ snapshots, assets,
  contributions, settings, trades })` is the only way to build the base — the service (`resolvePerformanceSetup`, the
  head of `getAllPerformanceData`), the page (since 2026-10-04 through that same `resolvePerformanceSetup`, in
  `usePerformanceData`: its `cachedSnapshots` and its custom range read the service's own resolution) AND
  `pdfDataService.preparePerformanceData` all go through it (until 2026-09-07 the PDF ran on
  the RAW snapshots with no pension flow, printing a different TWR and ROI under the same title; its scope line now
  carries `describeMeasurementBase`). It returns the projected snapshots, `excludedAssetIds`, `pensionEntryMonth`, the
  `pensionFlows` and the `portfolioFlows`; `buildCacheKey` fingerprints all of them (a contribution recorded today, or a
  trade in the ledger, rewrites the flows while every snapshot stays byte-identical). The base is resolved ONCE by
  `resolvePerformanceBase` for its THREE call sites (service, page, PDF); `buildCacheKey` fingerprints its options,
  entry month and both flow channels.
- **The flows follow the base** (2026-09-07, issue/PR #319 reimplemented on the base): a base is two halves, WHICH
  capital and WHICH flows, and the cashflow's savings are the capital that entered the NET WORTH — wrong the moment the
  base is a subset, since a purchase paid from an account outside it is capital coming in and the cashflow skips
  transfers. When anything is out of the base in any month (a role-excluded asset, the cash accounts with the toggle,
  the funds before entry or with the toggle off), `lib/utils/portfolioFlows.ts` measures the boundary crossings for
  every month whose two snapshots both carry `byAsset`: the **trade ledger** for an instrument from its first trade on
  (dated to the operation, buys plus fees in, sells net of fees out; a covered instrument with no trade in a month is a
  0, not a gap), the **quantity changes** `(q₁ − q₀) × p₁` for the others — a cash account inside the base counts its
  balance, so an internal purchase nets to zero and a deposit is outside money. A migration **baseline and an
  `adjustment` cover the instrument but move no money** (the original PR counted the baseline as a buy: −57% on the
  real account's July 2026). **Flow-opaque instruments** — every hand-valued asset except cash: pension funds,
  properties — contribute 0 to the quantity branch; the funds' money rides its own channel. A month with no entry is NOT
  measurable and falls back to the cashflow's savings; with nothing ever excluded the list is empty and not a decimal
  moves. **THE ENTRY MONTH** (2026-09-13, the trade date floor lifted): the ledger speaks for an instrument in a month
  only once the base has SEEN it — held in the previous snapshot, or bought inside the month; an instrument the
  snapshots meet for the first time with no trade in that month (a purchase recorded with its real, older date; an
  asset created in the migration month, whose baseline covers it) ENTERS at its end-of-month value on the quantity
  branch. Before that rule the ledger's «no trade = 0» read the whole position as that month's return (10 × 100 € bought
  in 2024 and typed in September: 1.000 € of phantom gain, proven by `portfolioFlows.test.ts`). The history before the
  app saw the instrument is not measured — a TWR cannot attribute two years of a price move to the month the position
  was typed in — and the backdated month itself produces no entry, since no snapshot pair holds the instrument.
  `CACHE_MATH_VERSION` v8. Declared limits: end-of-month price on the quantity branch, a split or an in-kind transfer
  reads as a flow, a trade left out of the ledger vanishes, interest credited on an account inside the base reads as
  a deposit.
- **«Liquidità fuori dalla base»** (`performanceExcludesCash`, default OFF): the `cash` accounts leave the base by TYPE,
  their `allocationRole` untouched (Allocazione keeps them); a money-market ETF has a price and stays in. It exists only
  now because without the measured flows it would read every purchase as return. `classifyContribution` reads the
  account too (`sourceCashAssetId`): a voluntary from an account OUT of the base is capital that entered the fund
  (`contribution`); from an account inside, in a measured month, it is a `transfer` (+amount) that cancels the balance
  drop the quantities counted — capital moved within the base; with the fund out and the month measured, the withdrawal
  IS the balance drop and the channel carries nothing.
- **The pension toggle wins over the allocation role.** A `pensionFund` answers to «Includi i fondi pensione» ONLY: its
  `allocationRole` (almost always `excluded`, two of the real account's three through the legacy flag) never vetoes it.
  Until 2026-09-06 the two exclusions were in OR and the toggle was a silent no-op on any fund marked excluded.
- **Funds in, but honest: the entry is a flow, the contributions are flows.** With the toggle ON the funds enter the base
  from `pensionEntryMonth` — the first snapshot at or after `resolvePensionReturnStart` (the setting, else the first
  recorded contribution) whose breakdown carries a fund — and stay OUT before it (actual values, `E₀` before `byAsset`),
  because before that month their growth is untracked contributions. In the entry month their whole value is a
  `PensionBoundaryFlow` of kind `entry`; every later contribution that came from OUTSIDE (TFR, employer, a voluntary
  withheld from payroll = no `linkedExpenseId`) is a `contribution` flow in its `valueEffectMonth`. With the funds OUT,
  a voluntary paid from a cash account (`linkedExpenseId` set) is a `withdrawal` flow: cash left the base. **The one
  rule: a contribution is a flow iff it crosses the base's boundary.** A toggle that is ON with nothing trackable keeps
  the funds out and the caption says why. On the real account (2026-09-06): YTD TWR 12,59% OFF, 12,02% ON, 16,28% had the
  contributions been read as return.
- **The flows ride their own channels, never `netCashFlow`.** `CashFlowData.pensionFlow` (merged by `mergePensionFlows`)
  and `CashFlowData.portfolioFlow` (merged by `mergePortfolioFlows`, `null`/absent = not measurable, `0` = measured and
  still) inside `calculatePerformanceForPeriod`/`calculateRollingPeriods`; `buildCashFlowMap` sums `externalFlowOf(cf)`
  = `(portfolioFlow ?? netCashFlow) + pensionFlow`, so TWR, volatility, drawdown, heatmap, Evoluzione and IRR see them
  without knowing; ROI and CAGR sum `externalFlowOf` over the series. `metrics.netCashFlow` stays the cashflow's savings
  (the Contributi tile's «Contributi netti»); `metrics.pensionFlow`/`pensionEntryFlow`/`pensionInternalFlow` and
  `metrics.portfolioFlow`/`flowSource`/`measuredFlowMonths` are shown apart («Capitale entrato nella base», with its
  coverage) — a 31.852 € entry printed as «messi da parte» would be a lie, and so would a purchase.
- **Drawdown runs on a geometric TWR index, never on `netWorth − cumulativeCashFlow`**: `buildTwrIndex` chains the SAME
  monthly return the heatmap shows.
- **The cache document is written through `removeUndefinedDeep`** (2026-09-06): the metrics carry explicit `undefined`s
  (`maxDrawdownDate` when the portfolio never fell, `dividendCategoryId` without the setting) and the client Firestore
  rejects them, so on such an account `performance-cache/{userId}` was NEVER written and every visit recomputed from
  scratch — the only trace a `console.warn` in the browser. Found because `e2e/performance.degraded.spec.ts` asserts on
  that document; the optional fields deserialize as absent.

## Rendimenti — the measurement window (`lib/services/performanceService.ts`)

- **The first snapshot of a period is ALWAYS the starting valuation, never a measured month — the window opens on the 1st
  of the month AFTER it.** A snapshot is an end-of-month photograph; this also fixes gaps for free.
- **`resolveHasBaseline(snapshots, nominalPeriodStart)` is the ONE answer to "is that first month before the period?"** —
  data-driven, never inferred from the period type. **The page must NEVER re-derive the window from `new Date()`**:
  `metrics.nominalPeriodStart` travels in the payload and `selectSnapshotsForMetrics` re-selects what the service used.
- **`monthsElapsed` vs `calculateMonthsDifference`: distance vs coverage.** Jan→Mar is 2 elapsed, 3 covered;
  annualization always uses the elapsed count. **IRR signs are the INVESTOR's stream** (`−startNW`, `+endNW`), and
  `null` means "no rate explains this stream", not "the solver gave up".
- **No silent filters inside a single metric.** Volatility must not drop extreme monthly returns — the removed value is
  either an untracked movement (still visible in the heatmap) or a real crash. Floors instead: volatility/Sharpe need
  ≥ 3 monthly returns, else `null` with a reason.
- **`buildCashFlowMap`/`monthKey` is the only monthly indexing of cash flows** — TWR, volatility, heatmap, Evoluzione and
  `drawdownSeries` read the SAME series, and flows in the same month are **summed**.
- **Below a YEAR the hero states the PERIOD return, not an annualized one** (`resolveHeroReturn`, `MIN_MONTHS_FOR_ANNUALIZATION`
  = 12 since 2026-09-20; it was 6): +4% over two months annualizes to "+26% a year", a forecast dressed as a measurement —
  and at nine months the page's most used window still printed «+16,0%» at 54px over a measured +11,8%. Only the displayed
  figure changes; the verdict's QUALITY stays on the annualised rate. **The Rendimento
  tile's second chip is the SAME return on the other basis** (`resolveCompanionReturnChip`, `deannualizeReturn` = the page's ONE
  de-annualisation): «cumulato in N mesi» beside an annualised hero, «annualizzato» beside a period hero from six months on;
  none below six months (an extrapolation) and at exactly twelve (a repeat). Until 2026-09-07
  it was the ROI captioned «ROI del periodo» (issue #324): a gain over the FIRST month's capital, +126% against a +134%
  cumulative TWR on the real account, +73% against +30% on another — not the period's return and growing with the window
  on a saver's account. The ROI keeps its formula and lives in the Dettaglio, the AI prompt and the PDF, worded «sul
  capitale iniziale». **ROI and CAGR correct for cash flows in two DIFFERENT ways and are not convertible**, so both
  tooltips state both formulas, and a non-positive starting capital yields `null` for every ratio (a negative one
  flipped the sign in silence until 2026-09-07).
- **Benchmark**: every model is EUR-converted (`applyFxConversion`, the portfolio is EUR-denominated) before the verdict's gap and the Benchmark tile are computed — one basis for the whole page since 2026-08-25 (the old table's USD default and its toggle are gone); while FX is loading nothing is ranked, only a FAILED FX route falls back to USD and the tile's aside says so.
  `benchmarkPeriodReturn.ts` is the single source for indexing + annualization — never re-inline it. Each benchmark's
  final value comes from **its own** last available month, or every cell renders "–".

## Rendimenti — a verdict over tiles (`app/dashboard/performance/page.tsx`, `components/performance/tiles/*`, `lib/utils/{performanceSummary,performanceNarrative}.ts`)

- **The subject is the window MEASURED, never the picker's name**: `describePerformancePeriod` says «Negli ultimi 11 mesi» when a 1-anno window finds eleven snapshots (the current month's is not there yet), «Da aprile» for a YTD whose first measured month is April. `numberOfMonths` and `startDate` come off the payload.
- **A gap beside a figure is on that figure's basis** (`resolveBenchmarkGap`, read by the verdict AND by the tile's chip since 2026-09-20 — until then the chip kept the annualised gap, 3,4 points beside a reading that said 2,5): below a year the hero is the period return, so the «N punti sopra il 60/40» clause de-annualises BOTH rates with `(1+r)^(n/12) − 1` — the annualised gap next to a period figure lied by a factor of three on four months. The headline's tone still comes from `summarizePerformance` (risk-adjusted vs the risk-free rate); the benchmark only decides «più del / meno del / quanto il 60/40», and «meno del» takes the neutral dot.
- **Direction follows the printed figure** (`printed`, `printedGap`): `−0,04%` prints as `0,0%` with no sign and reads «Rende»; a gap under 0,05 points is «in linea» in the verdict AND «alla pari» in the Benchmark tile — `computeBenchmarkRanking` counts `beaten`/`tied` on the same rounding, so the two sentences never contradict each other. A ranking without a portfolio TWR has no reading at all (`describeBenchmarkRanking` → null), never «nessun modello ha reso meno».
- **The drawdown story is `resolveDrawdownStory` over `buildTwrIndex` + `findMaxDrawdown`**: peak/trough/recovery as `PeriodMonth`s, `monthsToRecover`/`durationMonths` in CALENDAR months (`monthSpan`), null below `AT_PEAK_THRESHOLD` (a −0,02% dip is not a story). The payload's `maxDrawdownDate`/`drawdownPeriod` strings and its index-step `drawdownDuration`/`recoveryTime` are no longer displayed; `measureDrawdownSpan` in the service keeps the index semantics for the cache, so do not mix the two on one surface.
- **Sortino, growth-of-100 and the ranking are pure** (`computeSortinoRatio` with the volatility floor and no outlier filter, `buildGrowthOfHundred` with an explicit base point — `benchmark: null` on it when no model series exists —, `computeBenchmarkRanking` up to each model's own last month, `annualizeTWR` on the page's `numberOfMonths`). `flattenHeatmapReturns` is the ONE percent→decimal bridge; the old copy inside `BenchmarkComparisonChart` (with a ±50% filter the service had removed) went with the component.
- **«Oggi» only when the window ends at the latest snapshot**: `describeGrowthOfHundred`/`describeCapitalAndMarket` take a `WindowEnd` (`endsAtLatest` = the period's last snapshot IS the cached series' last) and otherwise name the month («a fine dicembre 2024»). A custom range that closes earlier must not say «oggi».
- **Italian articles**: «diciotto» starts with a consonant — `startsWithVowel` in `patrimonioNarrative.ts` (now exported, shared) no longer lists 18, which fixes «l'18%»/«gli 18» on every page; the plural «dei/degli» before an amount reduces the printed leading group (`degli 8000 €`, `dei 18.000 €`, `dei 1500 €` — mille); an elided article never lands on a minus («ROI negativo dell'8,1%», «ha perso il 2,3%»).
- **Plusvalenze realizzate is off the axis** (`aggregateRealizedByYear` on ALL trades) and absent without a closed sale — then «Capitale e mercato» takes 12 columns (a conditional span, like the Panoramica's Costi/Obiettivi), never a hidden spacer for a tile that may exist. A failed read of the ledger's meta is an `ErrorNotice` in its cell since 2026-10-14 (`resolveRealizedGainsState`, § Composizione mobile), never a vanished tile.
- **The heatmap is a `<table>`** (years are rows, months columns, `scope` on both) with sign-token fills at three alphas cut by ONE table, `HEATMAP_STEPS` (< 1 · < 2,5 · ≥ 2,5 — the cells through `heatmapCellStyle`, an inline `color-mix(in oklab, var(--positive) 30|55|85%, transparent)` because a class cannot cross-fade and an inline colour can; the legend prints the SAME thresholds, it said «−5% … 0 … +5%» until 2026-09-20). A measured month is a `<button>` inside its `td` and the grid is ONE Tab stop (`useRovingFocus`, Left/Right a month, Up/Down a year, Enter/tap pins, Escape releases); the figure is the reading line under the grid (`data-heatmap-reading`, `hovered ?? focused ?? pinned`), never a `title` and never a hover tip — on touch and for a sighted keyboard reader those were nothing. No figure is printed in a cell, so the AA text floor does not apply to the fills; cells are 44px tall below desktop (twelve columns leave ~21px of width).
- **The period TRANSFORMS, it is not replaced (2026-09-12, DESIGN.md → The Period-Transforms Rule).** There is no `key` on the tile grid any more (`periodRenderKey` is gone, and with it `renderKey`/`revealKey` down to the underwater chart): a period switch keeps every tile mounted and each one carries its own change. The hero glides from the figure it showed (`useCountUp({ fromPrevious: true })`), the two hand-written plots glide index by index (`useMorphingSeries` over `lib/utils/seriesMorph.ts`: the series on screen is RESAMPLED onto the incoming length by linear interpolation, then every index eases to its target in 420 ms; a `null` is a gap from the first frame; the resampling only ever describes where the glide starts, never what is measured — the hover reads `points`, the landed data, not the frame), the heatmap fades cell by cell (`transition-colors` on the inline fill) and its years enter/leave on a 220 ms fade (`AnimatePresence` over `motion.tr`), Attribuzione's rows re-rank in place (`layout="position"`, the 400/35 spring) and their bars slide to the new width (`transition-[width]`), the underwater area interpolates through Recharts. Reduced motion jumps everywhere (`useMorphingSeries` and `useCountUp` read `matchMedia`, the CSS transitions carry `motion-safe:`, the Framer pieces sit under `MotionConfig`). Only a REFRESH — which re-reads the data — dims the grid; a period switch never does. Two series measured on the same window (the seed's YTD and Storico, both feb–set of one year) draw the same path and glide nowhere: that is correctness, not a missing animation.
- **The page holds no loader and no effect for its reads** (2026-10-04): `usePerformanceData` derives everything from queries; the one state the page keeps beside the hook is the custom range's metrics.
- **recharts is not in Rendimenti's initial JavaScript** (2026-09-30): the tiles are hand-written SVG, and the Dettaglio's three plots — the two rolling charts (`components/performance/RollingLineChart.tsx`) and `UnderwaterDrawdownChart` — are `lazyComponent`s at module level in `PerformanceDettaglio` (`components/ui/lazy-component.tsx`, no Suspense), preloaded once the page is idle (`usePreloadWhenIdle`; the Dettaglio mounts after the data), so an opening draws them in that render (~4 ms on the mirror, 330 ms with `next/dynamic`); before the chunk each placeholder is 220px like the plot (`DETTAGLIO_CHART_HEIGHT`, `layout-shift` 0 at 1440 and 390). The initial JS went 686 → 566 KB gz; pinned by `e2e/bundle.lazy.spec.ts` (no placeholder ever seen after the chunk arrived; both halves seen red). An empty underwater series is decided in the Dettaglio (no chunk, no 220px box for one line); the rolling point types come from `RollingLineChart` as `import type` ONLY — a value import would put the module, and recharts, back in the page's graph.

## Rendimenti — Contributi: one answer (`summarizeCapitalEntered`, `components/performance/tiles/ContributiTile.tsx`)

- **The tile answers «quanto capitale è entrato nella base?» with ONE figure** (2026-09-20): `Σ externalFlowOf` over `metrics.cashFlows`,
  exactly what ROI, CAGR, TWR and IRR neutralise, split by the channel each month rode — `measured` (registro e quantità),
  `cashflow` (the months with no per-instrument detail; a quiet month has no row in the series, so the months come from
  `numberOfMonths`), `pension`. Each channel is rounded BEFORE the total, so the rows add up to the figure on screen.
- **The ledger and the cashflow are terms of comparison, never the answer** («Per confronto», muted rows): no formula reads them
  on a subset base. `computeInvestedCapital` no longer counts a migration BASELINE as a buy — a migration run in July put
  174.106 € of opening positions inside a year-to-date and the tile said «Hai investito 134.988 € dal registro» on an account
  that had bought 49.089 € and sold 53.436 €. The page is its only caller.
- **The reading names the ONE fact that explains the size** («per la maggior parte con l'ingresso del fondo pensione nella base a
  luglio 2026»); the channels' figures are rows, printed once. A flow is signed and never sign-coloured.

## Rendimenti — da dove viene il rendimento (`lib/utils/performanceAttribution.ts`, `components/performance/tiles/AttribuzioneTile.tsx`)

- **Euro, not percent, and reconciled.** `attributePeriodReturn` sums, per instrument, the price effect of every pair of
  the period's snapshots that BOTH carry `byAsset` (`attributeSelectedChange`, the Storico/Panoramica split: `q_prev ×
  (u_curr − u_prev)`, `u = totalValue/quantity` in EUR). The page's own gain over the same months is `Σ (ΔbaseNetWorth −
  externalFlow)` — the TWR numerator — and `unattributed = gain − Σ rows` is printed as the closing row («Non
  attribuito»: cash interest, a balance corrected by hand, a dividend recorded only in the cashflow), never spread over
  the rows. A per-instrument PERCENTAGE of a chained TWR is deliberately not shown: the arithmetic sum of monthly
  contributions is not the TWR, and a share of a small or negative gain explodes.
- **The three special cases are the overview digest's** (`computePriceEffectsByAsset`): a pension fund at price 1 is
  `Δvalue − contributions moved that month`, only for months AFTER `pensionEntryMonth` (the entry is a flow, the months
  before are not measured); real estate is measured gross of debt (`quantity × price`); a row at quantity 0 is a closed
  position — **fixed in `attributeSelectedChange` on 2026-09-06**: the cron writes every asset, sold ones included, and a
  `quantity 0, totalValue 0` row read as present had unit value 0, turning a 14.830 € sale into a −14.830 € PRICE effect
  (Xtrackers Overnight, 2026-08, visible in Storico › Valore per strumento).
- **Dividends per instrument come from the `dividends` registry** (`sumDividendsByAsset`: net EUR, `paymentDate` inside
  `[startDate, dividendEndDate]` — received, never announced), added to the instrument's row; the cashflow's dividend
  income is inside the gain, so a dividend recorded in only one of the two places lands in «Non attribuito».
- **Coverage is said** (`coverage.attributedMonths` of `measuredMonths`, first/last month): on a window that starts
  before `byAsset` (2025-11 on the real account) the reading names «nei N mesi con il dettaglio per strumento (da …)»
  instead of pretending the sum is the period's. Every sentence from `describeAttribution` (the tile) and
  `describeAttributionCoverage` (the Dettaglio's full table with Prezzo · Dividendi · Totale apart).
- **Grid** (2026-09-20): one row of the three tall tiles — Rendimento(5) · Benchmark(4) · Contributi(3) — then TWO COLUMNS whose
  tiles keep their natural height: left (7) this tile over Capitale e mercato, which takes the slack; right (5) Rischio ·
  Consistenza · Plusvalenze. The wrappers are `contents` below desktop, so the phone keeps its `order-*`. Rendimento used to
  span two rows (plot 669px tall, three neighbours half void). The tile lists the top 6 by |total| and folds the rest into «Altri strumenti», then
  «Non attribuito» and «Mercato» = the gain, so the rows visibly add up.
- **The residual guard says WHERE the residual comes from** (2026-09-07, the structural answer to issue #320, which
  asked for a per-month reconciliation between the ledger and the snapshots). A period's «Non attribuito» is a sum, and
  a sum hides whether it is nine small interest credits or one balance typed wrong in March: `attributePeriodReturn`
  also reads the residual MONTH BY MONTH against the month's starting base and returns in `residualMonths` (largest
  share first) every month whose unattributed part exceeds `RESIDUAL_ALERT_SHARE` (2%) of it. The tile's reading names
  the months in brackets («… non sono attribuibili a uno strumento (in marzo 2026 oltre il 2% della base)»), the
  Dettaglio's adds the figures and the three usual causes; at most three months are listed and the rest counted, never
  cut silently. It is a guard, not a diagnosis: the monthly figure is price effects only (the registry's dividends are
  netted at period level), so a large dividend credited to an account in the base trips it as honestly as a
  hand-corrected balance. A month that starts from a zero base has no share and is never flagged. A month whose
  unattributed part exceeds `RESIDUAL_ALERT_SHARE` (2%) of its starting base is NAMED in the reading
  (`residualMonths`) — where to look, never what happened.

## Composizione mobile

Composed on 2026-10-14 (MOB-05, retired the same day: its text is in `git log -- doc/mobile/`; the primitives and the sample page are Hall of Fame's, doc/guide/hall-of-fame.md § Composizione mobile; the decisions in doc/mobile/README.md § 9): below `desktop:` the page is one sequence, the desktop DOM (decisions 1 and 11); at 1440 it is the page above with three declared changes — the verdict's punctuation where the cut lands, Plusvalenze in error and Benchmark in error (below) — and the «dal massimo del periodo» clause in the verdict's sequel.

- **THE tile**: Rendimento (TWR) (`rend-twr`), first in the DOM at every width, open and never a row (decision 21); below `desktop:` its curve yields — `GrowthOfHundredChart` reads its floor from `--growth-min-h`, which `RendimentoTile` sets to 120px and to 160px from `desktop:` (decision 4) — the reading, the legend and «Come si calcola» stay.
- **The strip** (`selectPerformanceStrip`, `lib/utils/performanceSummary.ts`): «Rendimento {label}» → `heroReturn.value` on ITS basis — the period's return below a year, annualised from one, the label carrying it («nei 4 mesi», «negli 8 mesi» — `inMonths`, the article before the vowel-initial counts 8 and 11, fixed in the retirement of 2026-10-14 —, «annualizzato»: The Binding-Clause Rule's caption) → opens `rend-attribuzione`, or `rend-capitale` when no month of the window has a per-instrument breakdown; «Sul 60/40» (`shortBenchmarkName`, exported) → the gap on the SAME basis, in `points` — the page hands over `resolveBenchmarkGap`'s result and the strip never recomputes it (`performanceNarrative.ts` imports from `performanceSummary.ts`, so the strip cannot call it) → opens `rend-benchmark`; `null` says «non ancora misurabile», «in arrivo» while a series or the FX is in flight, «modello non disponibile» otherwise. Each cell prints EXACTLY what the verdict's sentence prints (`__tests__/performanceSummary.test.ts` holds the identity, built from the SAME `heroReturn`); the cells announce the rows from the controller's `eyebrows`. When the 60/40 lands after the first paint the gap cell goes from «in arrivo» to its figure and the verdict changes branch (below): the layout settles once, by design.
- **The cut** (`buildPerformanceVerdict`, decisions 3, 5 and 18): **with the model the title stands alone** — the first sentence would reprint both cells («+2,1%», «0,4 punti»), so `leadLength: 0` and «Il perché · rendimento, Sharpe, drawdown e mesi positivi» holds the whole paragraph (the declared «solo titolo» deroga, decision 18: a cell in points counts); **without it** the paragraph is cut at its first «;», which becomes a full stop at 1440 too («…con uno Sharpe di 1,08. Il drawdown massimo…», «…(TWR). Mai sotto il massimo…»; a clause opening with a figure stays as it is) — the Sharpe clause sits BEFORE that «;» and stays in sight, so the label is «Il perché · drawdown e mesi positivi» (owner, 2026-10-14, decision 76); **without a return** nothing is cut. No clause is `binding`.
- **The scope** (decision 13): the measured base («Base: portafoglio gestito, al netto…» with «Cambia base») is `PageVerdict.scope`, rendered once per width — after the strip below `desktop:`, under the paragraph at 1440 — and never behind a tap: without it «+2,1%» reads as the return of the whole net worth. A spec locating it takes the visible copy (`getByText(/^Base: /).locator('visible=true')`, `e2e/performance.degraded.spec.ts`).
- **Lifted blocks** (The Lifted-Figure Rule; `RendimentoTile.liftedFigures`, `RendimentoLiftedBlock = 'hero' | 'benchmark-chip' | 'drawdown-chip'`, guarded by `isRendimentoLiftedBlock`; `LIFTED_FIGURE_CLASS` = hidden below `desktop:`, the tablet included since 2026-10-16): the hero WITH its qualifier (the return cell carries both), the gap chip with a value (the «in arrivo» chip stays: a cell without a figure lifts nothing), **and the «dal massimo del periodo» chip whole, whose figure enters the verdict's sequel** — «…recuperato in 2 mesi; oggi a −1,2% dal massimo del periodo; …» (`drawdownToday`, decision 38; at 1440 a declared addition); at the peak, or a dip that prints as zero, the chip has no figure and the sentence adds nothing. The chip on the other basis stays. The chips' row hides whole when nothing of it would remain. At 1440 the hero and the chips are whole (no strip; until 2026-10-16 they were whole from 768 beside the strip too) — so **the tile's hero and chips sign and colour on the PRINTED value** (`printedSign`, `formatSignedPercentIt`, `formatSignedPoints` in `lib/utils/formatters.ts`, pinned by `__tests__/formatters.test.ts`; owner, retirement of 2026-10-14, decision 78): until then a +0,03% hero printed «+0,0%» in green beside a cell saying «0,0%», and a 0,03-point gap «+0 pt» beside «0 pt». The other Rendimenti surfaces (Benchmark's table, the heatmap, Attribuzione, Plusvalenze, the Dettaglio) still sign on the raw value, on purpose: no cell repeats them (AGENTS.md § Themes, the sign rule).
- **The axis** (decisions 2 and 12): `PerformancePeriodPicker` in `PageVerdict.axis` under the title, with the custom range as a 44px calendar icon after it (`aria-label` «Periodo personalizzato», the demo suffix as on the desktop button; on a second line when the five options take the width) and the active range's `CustomPeriodChip` under them — in the branch with too few snapshots too; the desktop picker beside the verdict is a second instance (`hidden desktop:block`), and so is the chip at 1440. «Analizza con AI» is a 44×44 `Sparkles` icon in the sticky navbar beside «Aggiorna», mounted in every state and disabled until there is a measure (`aiDisabled`) — **and while the page waits or failed a read** (owner, retirement of 2026-10-14, decision 79: in those branches the metrics can be held from the persisted cache while the dialog is not mounted, so a press left `showAIAnalysisDialog` true and the dialog opened, and spent, when the main branch came back; a window of seconds, never reproduced, held by no test: the branch is transient); each copy of an action writes `event.currentTarget` into its opener ref, so the focus returns to the copy that was pressed. **No test, probe or script presses it: it spends** (WORKFLOW.md § 3; the new spec counts `/api/ai/**` at zero).
- **The rows and their aside, in DOM order** (`PERFORMANCE_SECTIONS` in the page, ids `PERFORMANCE_SECTION_IDS`, the words `PERFORMANCE_CLOSED_ASIDES` in `performanceNarrative.ts` — never a figure; the asides of the open tiles keep the months, the risk-free rate and the window): `rend-benchmark` «contro i portafogli modello» · `rend-contributi` «capitale entrato nel periodo» · `rend-attribuzione` «per strumento» (present with a per-instrument window) · `rend-capitale` «versato e mercato» · `rend-rischio» «volatilità, Sharpe e drawdown» · `rend-consistenza` «mese per mese» · `rend-plusvalenze` «per anno fiscale» (present with a closed sale, or in error). The page hands the controller the rows PRESENT with their `failed` flags (`resolvePerformanceSections`, memoized on the three facts). All closed on a first visit; the heatmap, the capital chart and Attribuzione's re-ranking rows mount on the first opening (The Period-Transforms Rule holds for what is mounted). `TILE_ROW_CELL_CLASS` on their cells; `PageRest` right after THE tile's cell; the two desktop columns stay `contents` below `desktop:`. The key is `mobile-sections:performance`; «Il perché» is the row `perche`.
- **Benchmark in error** (decision 36): every one of the six series failed (`benchmarkResults.every(isError)`; one missing keeps the tile with «—» on its row) → `ErrorNotice` in the Benchmark cell at every width (`subject: 'Benchmark'`, `canRetry`: «Riprova» refetches the six keys through the client — `queryClient.refetchQueries`, not `result.refetch()`, which the React Compiler read as a later mutation of the results and dropped the verdict's memo), the gap cell «modello non disponibile»; below `desktop:` a failed row (`SectionSpec.failed`): open on every visit until closed, red eyebrow when closed, `live={!sections.compact}` so `PageRest` carries the ONE `role="alert"`.
- **Plusvalenze in error** (`resolveRealizedGainsState({ meta: { isError, data }, trades })` → `'absent' | 'failed' | 'ready'`): `failed` is the meta's read failed WITHOUT a document (`data === undefined`); a reread that fails over a document already held — the persisted cache included — stays `ready`, because the meta decides no figure of the verdict (unlike the six inputs `composeReadState` stops the page on); `absent` is a ledger never migrated, not read yet, or with no closed sale (Capitale e mercato takes the slack as before); `ready` the tile. With `failed`, an `ErrorNotice` at every width («Riprova» = the meta query's `refetch`), the same row shape as Benchmark. Until 2026-10-14 a meta in error read as «not migrated» and the tile vanished in silence. **Contributi loses its ledger row on the same failure and says nothing** — blind spot, below (decision 37).
- **The verdict's memo and the React Compiler** (2026-10-14): the composition's block (sections, strip, lifted blocks) sits BEFORE the verdict's `useMemo` in the page — `selectPerformanceStrip` takes the gap, which the compiler reads as an alias of the reference row, and a call on it after the memo counted as a later mutation of a dependency («Compilation Skipped», `__tests__/reactCompilerCoverage.test.ts` is the map).
- **The skeleton is the 1440 grid, the composition is not** (declared in the retirement of 2026-10-14, as the Panoramica's): while the payload loads the page shows `TileGridSkeleton` with its seven cells and a toolbar at every width, so below `desktop:` the first paint JUMPS from seven grey tiles to the title, the axis, the strip, THE tile and the closed rows when the data lands — a declared jump, not a defect; the persisted cache (doc/guide/cache-persistita.md) makes it a first-visit-only sight.
- **768/1024 and the specs**: since 2026-10-16 (MOB-08, `lib/utils/tabletComposition.ts`; doc/mobile/README.md § 9, 104) the tablet's composition — at 768 two columns: Rendimento on both, «Il resto» on a row of its own, the rows two by two in DOM order, an open row (a failed read, open on its own) and a closed one left alone on the whole grid row; at 1024 Rendimento on the left and the 360px rail with «Il resto» and every row, each opening in place; the two `contents` wrappers keep the rows items of the page grid. No tablet spec: the composition is held by `e2e/*.tablet.spec.ts` on the Panoramica and Tracciamento. `e2e/mobile-composition.performance.degraded.mobile.spec.ts` (project `degraded-mobile`, seven tests at 390 on the `performance` fixture, the six series and the FX answered by the browser with a flat invented month, one test aborting them: the first screen, the AI icon never pressed, the calendar's focus, the gap cell, the memory, the failed row, the order and the overflow), `e2e/performance.degraded.spec.ts` (1440: the reload test compares the title and the paragraph, since the region now holds the hidden axis, strip and scope and the gap cell moves with the non-persisted series), `e2e/modal.origin.spec.ts` (unchanged). **Not proven in a browser**: the meta in error (the Firestore client has one channel for every read) and the companion chip's lift exemption (the fixture measures three months, below the six a companion chip needs).

## Per-page blind spots

- **The ledger's meta in error is a row, its consequence on Contributi is not** (2026-10-14, decision 37): with the meta unreadable Plusvalenze is a red row and Contributi simply loses its «Registro operazioni» comparison row, saying nothing — a reader sees one failure where there are two surfaces of it. No spec of the series schedules a second notice; and the meta's failure itself is not reproducible in a browser (one Firestore channel for every read), so `resolveRealizedGainsState` is held by Vitest alone.
- **The first screen moves once when the model lands late** (2026-10-14): the gap cell goes from «in arrivo» to its figure and the verdict from the cut paragraph to «title only» — a settle, not a flicker; the six series are read on every visit (6h `staleTime`, not persisted).
- **The yields follow TODAY's window, the cached metrics the window of when they were cached** (2026-10-04). On a fresh
  computation the two are one derivation. On the first visit after a month rollover, with no new snapshot and the cache
  still inside its six hours, the metrics still describe last month's window (the known residual of `buildCacheKey`) while
  the yields are asked on this month's: for those hours YOC and current yield are annualised over a window one month off
  the hero's. «Aggiorna» realigns them. And the yields' dividend cap is the instant the page was OPENED (or last
  refreshed), not the instant of each render.
- **Rendimenti**: `e2e/performance.degraded.spec.ts` covers the structure only (the base caption, the attribution tile, the pension channel on and off); the six benchmark series + FX load on every visit (6h `staleTime`), only a FAILED FX route falls back to USD (the aside says so); Sharpe/Sortino use the settings' risk-free rate; the payload's `drawdownDuration`/`recoveryTime` are no longer displayed (the tiles read `resolveDrawdownStory`); a 1-anno window without the current month's snapshot measures 11 months and says so; the rolling readings live in `PerformanceDettaglio` (untested; a rolling CAGR with no measurable rate is `null` and leaves a gap, never a 0); `AIAnalysisDialog` starts its analysis ON OPEN by decision (one click = the report) and ABORTS it on close, client and server (`request.signal` → the SDK's `{ signal }`; an abort is not an error and logs nothing) — a probe that only «opens and escapes» it still spends a call; **a refusal is an HTTP 200 with `stop_reason: 'refusal'`** (Sonnet 5.5, 2026-10-12): the route turns it into one `{ error }` before `[DONE]` — «rifiutato» with no text, «interrotto … incompleto» after some, the text left on screen — and so does a **`max_tokens` cut** (the 16000 ceiling covers thinking AND text: «esaurito lo spazio» with no text, «lunghezza massima … incompleto» after some), and «Rigenera» stands beside any failure, not only beside a written report (`e2e/performance.degraded.spec.ts` answers the route in the browser, nothing reaches Anthropic); **the route runs with the server-side fallback** (same day, owner's decision: `anthropic.beta.messages` with `betas: [SERVER_SIDE_FALLBACK_BETA]` + `fallbacks: 'default'`, sdk ≥ 0.115): a `cyber` or `frontier_llm` decline goes on in the same stream on Sonnet 5, the text already written stays, and the route sends a `{ model }` chunk from `message_start` and from each `fallback` block, so «scritto da …» names the model that wrote the report — «claude-sonnet-5 (claude-sonnet-5-5 aveva rifiutato la richiesta)» after a fallback (`describeReportAuthor`), never the constant it asked for; the other categories still end on the refusal sentence, and a fallback is logged with both models (no counter of refusals exists beyond the log); **with the pension toggle ON, a period that straddles `pensionEntryMonth` carries the funds' whole value as a flow in that month** — «Capitale immesso» jumps by it and the Contributi tile names it as the entry, not as savings; **a pension fund's statement credited late still reads as a temporary market loss** (the Previdenza blind spot, now on this page too); **«Non attribuito» is not a bug**: it is every euro that moved the total without moving an instrument's unit value, and on the real account it was −2.326 € on a 16.836 € YTD gain — since 2026-09-07 the months where it exceeds 2% of the base are named, not explained (a dividend landing in cash trips the guard too); **on any account with something out of the base — the default — the months with `byAsset` on both snapshots neutralise the MEASURED boundary flows, not the cashflow's savings** (2026-09-07): a deposit on an account inside the base is a flow even if no income row exists, interest credited on it reads as a deposit, a split or an in-kind transfer as a purchase, a trade left out of the ledger vanishes for a covered instrument, and the months before `byAsset` (2025-11 on the real account) still use the cashflow — the Contributi tile says how many months were measured; **«Liquidità fuori dalla base» measured on the real account (2026-09-07, in memory)**: ON → YTD 15,36% (OFF 14,73%), 1Y 16,81% (16,03%), ALL 29,76% (27,08%), measured flows +5.058 € (the net buys) instead of −650 € (the accounts' net balance change); the four accounts are 3% of the base, so the gain is cleanliness, not size, and the ALL window stays mixed before 2025-12 because the cashflow's savings landed on accounts that are then outside the base.
- **Rendimenti before `byAsset`: correct denominator, wrong numerator** (2023-01 → 2025-10 on the real account): the basis step is removed, but the excluded assets' variation stays inside the measured return. Not reconstructible — and those months cannot be attributed to an instrument either: «Da dove viene il rendimento» names the months it covers. (moved from `CLAUDE.md` → Known Issues on 2026-09-19)
- **«Non attribuito» in Rendimenti is a measurement, not a bug**: cash interest, balances corrected by hand, expenses paid from untracked accounts and dividends recorded in only one of cashflow/registry all move the total without moving an instrument's unit value (−2.326 € on a 16.836 € YTD gain on the real account). Per-instrument dividends come from the `dividends` registry, the gain from the cashflow: a dividend present in one place only lands there. With the pension toggle ON, a period straddling the entry month carries the funds' whole value as a flow in that month, and a late-credited statement reads as a temporary market loss on this page too. (moved from `CLAUDE.md` → Known Issues on 2026-09-19)
- **TWR monthly-bucket artifact (by design)**: an expense is neutralised only when the net-worth drop and the cash flow land in the same month; recording a purchase both as an expense and as an asset produces a phantom gain. Record balances in the month they belong to. Since 2026-09-07 the months with `byAsset` on both snapshots neutralise the MEASURED boundary flows (`portfolioFlows`) instead of the cashflow's savings, and since 2026-09-13 the ledger speaks for an instrument only once the base has SEEN it — the rules are above in this guide (its stub: AGENTS.md § 3); the Contributi tile says how many months were measured. (moved from `CLAUDE.md` → Known Issues on 2026-09-19)
